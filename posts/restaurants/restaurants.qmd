Let's analyze the `restaurant` data:

```{r}
restaurant <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv')
```


```{r}
#| results: asis
rmarkdown::paged_table(restaurant) 
```


## Variable Description

CAMIS:
This is an unique identifier for the entity (restaurant);
10-digit integer

DBA:
This field represents the name (doing business as) of the entity (restaurant);
Public business name, may change at discretion of restaurant owner
BORO:
Borough in which the entity (restaurant) is located.;
• 1 = MANHATTAN
• 2 = BRONX
• 3 = BROOKLYN
• 4 = QUEENS
• 5 = STATEN ISLAND
• 0 = Missing;

CUISINE DESCRIPTION:
This field describes the entity (restaurant) cuisine.
ACTION:
This field represents the actions that is associated with each restaurant inspection. ;
• Violations were cited in the following area(s).
• No violations were recorded at the time of this inspection.
• Establishment re-opened by DOHMH
• Establishment re-closed by DOHMH
• Establishment Closed by DOHMH.
• Violations were cited in the following area(s) and those requiring immediate action were addressed.

VIOLATION CODE:
Violation code associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection
VIOLATION DESCRIPTION:
Violation description associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection

CRITICAL FLAG:
Indicator of critical violation;
• Critical
• Not Critical
• Not Applicable;
Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to food-borne illness

SCORE:
Total score for a particular inspection;

GRADE:
Grade associated with the inspection;
• N = Not Yet Graded
• A = Grade A
• B = Grade B
• C = Grade C
• Z = Grade Pending
• P = Grade Pending issued on re-opening following an initial inspection that resulted in a closure


## Summary Statistics

First, we can find the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of SCORE for each GRADE of restaurants

```{r}
restaurant %>% group_by(GRADE) %>% skim(SCORE) %>% select(-n_missing)
```

## Restaurant Grade

How many restaurants with a GRADE of A are there in NYC?

How much percentage of restaurants in NYC are a GRADE of C?

```{r}
freq <- as.data.frame( table(restaurant$GRADE) )
prop <- as.data.frame( 100 * prop.table(table(restaurant$GRADE)) )
```

## Relationship - Score, Grade, Critical Flag

We will look at  visualization to show how the distribution of SCORE varies by GRADE and CRITICAL FLAG.

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = SCORE, y = GRADE, fill = GRADE) ) +
  facet_grid( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ . )
```
We could also show this same relationship using a histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_wrap( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ GRADE, scales = 'free' )
```

## Relationship - Critical Flag, Grade, Boro

Next, we will look at how the proportion of CRITICAL FLAG varies by GRADE and BORO, this time using a barplot.

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = `CRITICAL FLAG`,
               y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  facet_grid( GRADE ~ BORO )
```
